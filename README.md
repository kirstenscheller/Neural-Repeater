# neuralrepeater
We use analog circuits to design a neural repeater capable of bridging a full or partial break in the spine. This consists of a low noise amplifier, a comparator to filter out neural spikes, and a stimulator. The circuits were designed and simulated in Cadence. Created by Melissa Alvarez, Dan Buscaglia, Aratrika Ghatak, and Kirsten Scheller.
